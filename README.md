## Pomodoro?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.

There are six steps in the original technique:

1. Decide on the task to be done.
1. Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).
1. Work on the task.
1. End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
1. If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes) and then return to step 2; otherwise continue to step 6.
1. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.
